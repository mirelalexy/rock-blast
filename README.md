## Features

### 🛸 The Arena
- **Doom**: Each asteroid has a number (1–4) showing how many rockets it takes to obliterate it.  
- **Rainbow Rocks**: Color and size change depending on the asteroid’s rocket count — tiny red snacks or massive pink space boulders!  
- **Random Floaters**: Asteroids glide in linear trajectories with unpredictable speeds.  

### 🚀 Spaceship
- **Space... triangle?**: Your trusty ship, ready to zoom around the cosmos, in the shape of a triangle.  
- **Acrobat/Pilot**: Arrow keys let you dodge and sneak past asteroids.  
- **Dizzy**: Rotate left or right to line up epic shots.  
- **Not Powerless!**: Fire rockets in your current facing direction.  

### 🔥 Rockets
- **Mini Missiles**: Rockets travel from your ship to your target asteroid.  
- **Boom!**: Rockets reduce asteroid health on impact.  
- **Where Are All My Rockets?**: Only 3 rockets can be airborne at a time, but sometimes your ship will play tricks on you and you will only get 1 or 2. Choose your target wisely.

### 💥 Collisions
- **Bounce**: When asteroids collide, they ricochet along new paths.  
- **Showdown**: Colliding with an asteroid costs a life and restarts the game until you’re out.  

### ❤️ Life & Score
- **Point Collector 3000**: Destroy an asteroid to earn 200 points.  
- **Surprise...?**: Reach 5000 points to earn an extra life!  

### 📱 Touchscreen
- **Gotta Go!**: Full touchscreen support so you can blast asteroids on the go.  

### 🏆 Highscores
- **Top 5 Pilots**: *Rock Blast* saves the top 5 scores and player names using Web Storage. Will you make the leaderboard?
